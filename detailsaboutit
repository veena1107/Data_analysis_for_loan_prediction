# Loan Eligibility Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a loan applicant is eligible for a loan using machine learning algorithms. It helps automate the loan approval process by analyzing applicant financial and personal details.

## Problem Statement

Loan approval is usually done manually and depends on multiple factors such as income, credit history, and employment status. Manual evaluation is time-consuming and may lead to biased decisions. This project uses machine learning to predict loan eligibility efficiently.

## Objectives

- Predict loan approval status based on applicant data
- Reduce manual effort in loan approval process
- Improve accuracy and consistency in decision making
- Analyze factors affecting loan eligibility

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following attributes:
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Education
- Applicant Income
- Coapplicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Loan Amount Term
- Credit History
- Property Area
- Loan Status (Target Variable)

Dataset source: Publicly available loan dataset (e.g., Kaggle)

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (Optional)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow

1. Data collection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Feature encoding and scaling
5. Model training
6. Model evaluation
7. Loan eligibility prediction

## Model Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-eligibility-prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
   cd loan-eligibility-prediction

3. Install required libraries
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook
   jupyter notebook

## Results

The Random Forest model achieved the best performance compared to other algorithms. Credit history and income were the most important features influencing loan approval.

## Future Scope

- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
- Improve accuracy using hyperparameter tuning
- Add real-time prediction interface
- Use advanced algorithms like XGBoost.
